<h3>Go Mad!</h3>
	<p>I enjoy long, {{adjective1 || "_________"}} walks on the beach, getting {{verb1 || "_________"}} in the rain and serendipitous encounters with {{noun1}}. I really like piña coladas mixed with {{liquid || "_________"}}, and romantic, candle-lit {{noun2 || "_________"}}. I am well-read from Dr. Seuss to {{person || "_________"}}. I travel frequently, especially to {{place || "_________"}}, when I am not busy with work. (I am a {{occupation || "_________"}}.) I am looking for {{noun3 || "_________"}} and beauty in the form of a {{nationality || "_________"}} goddess. She should have the physique of {{female || "_________"}} and the {{noun4 || "_________"}} of {{friend || "_________"}}. I would prefer if she knew how to cook, clean, and wash my {{noun5 || "_________"}}. I know I’m not very attractive in my picture, but it was taken {{number + 365 || "_________"}} days ago, and I have since become more {{adjective2 || "_________"}}.</p>
